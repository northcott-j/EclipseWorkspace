<!!<!< THE APPLE GAME >!>!!>

The LowNo Apple Game is fairly easy to play. The left and right arrow keys are used to move your shopping cart back and forth. The goal of the game is to catch 10 apples in your cart. But there's a twist....
Each apple that you catch slows your cart. You will have to start predicting where the apples will fall so that you can get there before they reach the ground.
